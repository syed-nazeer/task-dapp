# task-dapp
Basic to-do-list application using blockchain technology as a decentralized system



## Client side 

This application has client side on which users will interact with the blockchain

For building this client side interface we have used react.js and for this client to be able to interact with the smart contract(Code on the blockchain) we have used ether.js

Metamask is a wallet which helps us to make transactions and metamask converts our normal web3 browser into a blockchain browser




## Server side 

We wrote smart contracts which will be deployed on the local ethetreum blockchain, we interact with these smart contracts on the blockchain from the client side interface

We used hardhat to make compiling and deployment of smart contracts easy

We wrote test cases for the smart contract functionalities so that they will behave as we expected them to do after the deployment

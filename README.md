## About application

This is just a basic todolist application

By doing this we wanted to understand how to build a decentralized application

Every time we add or delete a task it changes the state of the blockchain so we have to pay gas(ethers) through a wallet(Metamask)



## Client side 

We have used react js to build the frontend part by which users will interact with the blockchain

By using etherjs we can make the client side to be able to interact with the blockchain 

We have used rinkeby faucet to get free test tokens(Ethers)




## Server side

We have used solidity to write smart contracts and used hardhat which gives a basic template to compile and deploy these contracts on a local blockchain

We have wrote scripts to test our smart contract functionalities so that our smart contract behaves as we expected after the deployment
